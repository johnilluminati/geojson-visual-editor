# GeoJSON Visual Editor - Work-in-Progress

The purpose of this project is to provide a live visual editor for GeoJSON. You upload the GeoJSON you want to work with, and it will be shown on the map on the page as well as a code editor on the page as well. You can add/edit "properties" values by either selecting shapes from the map or doing so in the code editor. And when you make a change from the map or editor, then the change will be reflected in both places.

The intent for now is just the ability to add/edit "properties" values.
